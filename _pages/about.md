Welcome! I am Tianyi Wang <img src="/images/waving_hand.gif" width="24" style="vertical-align:middle;">
======

Tianyi is a **PhD Candidate** at the **[Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School (SIGS)](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/)**, **[Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/)**, under the supervision of Associate Professor **[Bo Zheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=8Xyqf_0AAAAJ)**. His research focuses on **satellite-based inference of atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions**, with particular emphasis on **carbon dioxide (CO₂)**, **nitrogen oxides (NOₓ)**, and **data-driven atmospheric inversion methods**.

His work integrates **satellite observations** (e.g., **[OCO-2](https://oco.jpl.nasa.gov/)** and **[TROPOMI](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-5p)**), **machine learning**, and **physics-informed modeling** to develop **fast and accurate inversion frameworks** that bridge satellite measurements with **bottom-up emission inventories** and **chemical transport models**. His research aims to support **air quality management**, **carbon monitoring**, and **climate change mitigation** from regional to global scales.

### Research Interests
- Satellite remote sensing of atmospheric composition  
- Greenhouse gas and air pollutant emission inversion  
- Data-driven and physics-informed inversion modeling
